# blok-tech
Welcome to my blok-tech repo. This is a study project that I followed on my course Communication & Multimedia Design at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam.
For this project all students need to make a matching application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Node.js), both back-end and front-end. The past couple of weeks I learned a lot of new things making this application and I enjoyed it a lot. Have a look around in this repo and the wiki to learn about how I made it.

## My matching app
All students had to think about a concept for a matching app that they wanted to make. Initially I thought of a matching app that matches the user with a disability to a restaurant with different kinds of accessability (think wheelchair accessability or a menu in braille). When I couldn't find a suitable API for this concept I had to let this idea go. After a bit of time I came up with this concept: **StopFinder**. I found this API with information about all public transport stops in Amsterdam. Stopfinder finds the user the nearest stop with wheelchair accessability so they won't get there and stand in front of a station which the can't enter. 

As a developer and designer I'm all for inclusion, design needs to be accessable for everyone in any situation. That's why I came up with this concept. 

## How to install StopFinder locally on your computer

1. Create a folder in the documents folder of you local computer.
2. Open your terminal. If you haven't already install homebrew using the following guide: 
3. In the terminal, go to the map using `cd./Documents/yourfoldername`. 
4. In this map, clone the git repo using this commmand: `https://github.com/sybrenmolenaar/blok-tech`.
5. Install the git package npm. 
6. In the terminal type `git install npm`.
7. Now it's time to run the app. In the terminal type `npm start`. This will start the application. You will now be able to run the app listening on localhost:3000.
